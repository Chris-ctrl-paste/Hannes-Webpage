              <strong>Iilahti Sans</strong>  As a final project from Novia University of Applied <br>
              Sciences I had the opportunity to challenge myself to design a <br>
              typeface. The work is thoroughly described from both a personal, <br>
              theoretical and a practical standpoint<br> <br>

              <strong>Research</strong><br>

              In the early stages of the project I did research on different 
              <br>classes of type, their use, history and characteristics, also how <br>
              different letterforms are constructed and the importance 
              of <br>compensating for optical illusions when designing type.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Concept</strong><br>

              At the age of 7 I spray painted my first graffiti painting, on a <br>
              plywood board in my granddads garage, ever since then I’ve<br>
              been drawing and painting letters in all kinds of shapes<br>
              and forms. I’ve always felt that graffiti and typography have many <br>
              similarities, even tough they are quite different from each others.<br> 
              In this project I have tried to merge my interest in graffiti with <br>
              traditional type design to create a typeface that has a personal <br>
              touch yet usable.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Design</strong><br>

              The design process is described step by step. Starting with <br>
              introducing the font editor software, followed by how and what <br>
              letters are created together, describing the similarities and <br>
              differences between letters, and lastly a brief description of how <br>
              the tracking and kerning is adjusted for a typeface.

              <br><br>
              <strong>Result</strong><br>

              Iilahti Sans is a low contrast geometric sans-serif typeface with <br>
              playful features that comes in two weights, regular and bold.<br>
              Iilahti Sans is best suited as a display typeface in big sizes. <br>
              The final project is presented in a 124-page book printed in 10 copies.
